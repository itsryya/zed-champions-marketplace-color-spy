# Zed Champions Marketplace Rare and Super Rare Color Spy

A Tampermonkey script to identify and filter rare and super rare colored horses on the Zed Champions Marketplace, with scroll tracking and color counts.

## üìù Overview

This [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) script enhances the Zed Champions Marketplace experience by allowing users to spot and filter horses with rare and super rare colors. It adds a sticky filter bar at the top of the marketplace page with buttons for each color, displaying counts of matching horses. Users can toggle filters to show only specific colors and track their scrolling progress.

### Features

- **Color Filters**: Buttons for rare (R) and super rare (SR) colors to filter horses.
- **Color Counts**: Displays the number of horses for each color (e.g., "Torch Red (3)").
- **Scroll Tracking**: Shows the number of horses scrolled past, visible horses, and total loaded horses.
- **Sticky UI**: Filter bar stays at the top of the page while scrolling.
- **Responsive Design**: Buttons and status wrap to fit the screen width.

## Usage

   - Click the button again to deselect and show all horses.
   - Multiple colors can be selected at once.

   - Counts update as you scroll and more horses load.

3. **Track Scrolling**:
   - The status box at the end of the filter bar shows:
     - Number of horses scrolled past (e.g., "180").
     - Visible horses after filtering / Total loaded horses (e.g., "180/180").
     - "H" for "Horses".

4. **Responsive Layout**:

## Script Details

- **1.8** (as of the script‚Äôs metadata)

## Known Issues

- If the marketplace uses virtualization (removing cards from the DOM when not in view), counts may not reflect all horses. This script assumes all loaded cards remain in the DOM.
- On very narrow screens, the filter bar may wrap more frequently; adjust browser width if needed.
- Make sure to activate developer mode in the tampermonkey extension.
